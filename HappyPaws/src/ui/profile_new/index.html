                        <h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
                        <p>
                            Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog
                            of medium size and great endurance, was developed to
                            work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate
                            speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are
                            friendly, fastidious, and dignified. The graceful,
                            medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can
                            be either brown or blue'and sometimes one of
                            each'and convey a keen but amiable and even
                            mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed,
                            Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly
                            effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than
                            60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter
                            than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. As
                            born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on
                            well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness
                            render them indifferent watchdogs. These are
                            energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small
                            animals, so secure running room is a must. An
                            attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally
                            clean, with little doggy odor.

                        <p>
                            Fortunately, the Siberian Husky is a relatively
                            healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen their
                            breeding stock for health problems such as juvenile
                            cataracts, and the breed's national parent club, the
                            Siberian Husky Club of America, has strict
                            guidelines to help reduce reported cases. Beginning
                            at 12 months of age, all Siberians who potentially
                            will be part of a breeding program should be
                            examined by a canine ophthalmologist. The exam is
                            then repeated on a yearly basis. New screenings and
                            tests are being constantly being developed to help
                            breeders in their selection of a potential dam and
                            sire. Knowledgeable breeding practices ensure the
                            future health of the breed. Owners of working
                            Siberians need to closely monitor each dog to be
                            able to recognize when something just isn't right.
                            Having a veterinarian familiar with working dogs is
                            an advantage. Recommended Health Tests From the
