						<h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
						<p>
							Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size
							and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light
							loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are
							friendly, fastidious, and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized
							Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or
							blue'and sometimes one of each'and convey a keen but amiable and
							even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians
							are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait.
							Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably
							smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute.
							As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with
							other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness render them indifferent
							watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small
							animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature
							of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.
						</p>
						<br /><br />
						<h2>Health</h2>
						<p>
							Fortunately, the Siberian Husky is a relatively healthy breed.
							Responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health
							problems such as juvenile cataracts, and the breed's national
							parent club, the Siberian Husky Club of America, has strict
							guidelines to help reduce reported cases. Beginning at 12 months
							of age, all Siberians who potentially will be part of a breeding
							program should be examined by a canine ophthalmologist. The exam
							is then repeated on a yearly basis. New screenings and tests are
							being constantly being developed to help breeders in their
							selection of a potential dam and sire. Knowledgeable breeding
							practices ensure the future health of the breed. Owners of working
							Siberians need to closely monitor each dog to be able to recognize
							when something just isn't right. Having a veterinarian familiar
							with working dogs is an advantage. Recommended Health Tests From
